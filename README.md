# odd - Orion Dice Decide
My javascript *apprentice piece*.
It's a poker dice game that is totally pointless and unfinished.
I'm an experienced coder, but not with js and thought this would be a good way to explore graphics, logic etc.
It was.
Blew my mind when I realised that js objects could contain other js objects and arrays.
Immediately dropped the project to return to my main project letcomm.
Anybody fancies finishing it off/improving here let me know.
