# odd - Orion Dice Decide
My javascript *apprentice piece*.

It's a poker dice game alternative to tossing a coin. 

Pretty pointless, I know, but I've used it as a vehicle to explore javascript.

I'm an experienced coder, but not with js and thought this would be a good way to explore graphics, logic etc.

It was.

Blew my mind when I realised how powerful js objects were. Once I learnt they could contain other js objects and arrays..

So much so that, it totally changed my direction in my main project *Letcomm*, and leaving *odd* hanging..for now..

Never really got to explore the background animation code I built. At the moment it uses just half a dozen images, it's designed for 50+.

Any coders fancy playing with it let me know. It's currently on *GitLab*, havn't got round to moving it here.
